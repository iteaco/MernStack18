    load bundle.js explicitly only when not use with WebPack. If you use WebPack, WebPack will load it for you.
    If you use WebPack and also load bundle.js explicitly, you will get 2 errors in the browser console: 
    GET http://localhost:9090/dist/bundle.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found) 
    Refused to execute script from 'http://localhost:9090/dist/bundle.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.

<!-- <script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script> --> <!-- /dist/bundle.js contains the src\index.js which calls document.getElementById("root"). If we put /dist/bundle.js in the <head>, it may cause problem because at that time <div id="root"></div> is not present yet. -->

<!-- Why load JS in the bottom? Because we want the HTML DOM to load first. If we load the JS first, some HTML tags may NOT be ready at that time. Use async if the JS does NOT need to wait for the HTML DOM to load first. -->
